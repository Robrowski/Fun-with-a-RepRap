mkdir ~/Hello-World
# Creates a directory for your project called "Hello-World" in your user directory


cd ~/Hello-World
# Changes the current working directory to your newly created directory


git init
# Sets up the necessary Git files

# Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/Hello-World/.git/

touch README
# Creates a file called "README" in your Hello-World directory
